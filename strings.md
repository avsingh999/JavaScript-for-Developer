#Strings in Javascript
Strings are primitive values in Javascript.
They are usually used to store text.
A string is composed of zero or more characters between simple or double quotes ```""``` or ```''```.

#Examples of strings

console.log("Hello") //"Hello"
console.log('Hello') //"Hello"
console.log("") //""
```
