# while loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

## Syntax
```
while(condition) {
    // your code
}
```

## example 

```
let i = 0;
while(i < 10) {
    console.log('the value of i = ',i);
    i++;
}
```

## output 

```
The value of i = 0
The value of i = 1
The value of i = 2
The value of i = 3
The value of i = 4
The value of i = 5
The value of i = 6
The value of i = 7
The value of i = 8
The value of i = 9
```

At i = 10 condition becomes false and while loop terminates.
