**JavaScript** (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as **Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat**. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## Javascript Tutorial
### Variables
Javascript Variables is a container for storing data values
*Example :*
```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = 5;
console.log(x);
```
x is variable and store 10 as values
y is variable and store 5 as values

### Comments
Comments is syntax for developing purpose, comment doesn't executed to browser
*Example :*
```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is first multi-line comment
This is multi-line comment
this is the end of multi-line comment */
```
// is used for write single line comment
/*...*/ is used for write multi-line comment

### Operators
#### Assignment
You can assignment variable with (=) operators
*Example :*
```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = 5;
```
#### Arithmetic
You can perform arithmetic with javascript
*Example :*
```javascript
var x = 10;
var plus = x + 20;
var minus = x - 5;
var times = x * 20;
var divide = x / 2;
var modulus = x % 3;
var exp = x ** 2;
```
(+) is for Addition
(-) is for Substraction
(\*) is for Multiplication
(/) is for Division
(%) is for Modulus
(\*\*) is for exponentation

#### Assignment Arithmetic
You can perform arithmetic more efficient with assignment arithmetic
*Example :*
```javascript
var x = 10;
x += 20;
x -= 5;
x *= 20;
x /= 2;
```
