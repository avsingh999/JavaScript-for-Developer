**JavaScript** (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as **Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat**. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

### Algorithm

<br/>
### There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

<p align="center"> 
1. number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
2. bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
3. string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4. boolean for true/false.
5. null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
6. undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
7. object for more complex data structures.
8. symbol for unique identifiers.
9. The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

### Two forms: typeof x or typeof(x).
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.
