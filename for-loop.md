# for of loop and for in loop 

## for...in
The for...in statement iterates over all enumerable properties of an object that are keyed by strings (ignoring ones keyed by Symbols), including inherited enumerable properties.

```
const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

for (const property in object) {
  console.log(`${property}: ${object[property]}`);
}

// expected output:
// "a: 1"
// "b: 2"
// "c: 3"

```


## for...of

The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.

```
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (const element of array1) {
  console.log(element);
}

// expected output: "a"
// expected output: "b"
// expected output: "c"

```
