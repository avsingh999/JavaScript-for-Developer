### There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

<p align="center"> 
1. number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
2. bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
3. string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4. boolean for true/false.
5. null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
6. undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
7. object for more complex data structures.
8. symbol for unique identifiers.
9. The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

### Two forms: typeof x or typeof(x).
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.
